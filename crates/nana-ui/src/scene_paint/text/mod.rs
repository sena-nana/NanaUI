//! Nothing below the resolver knows what laid the paragraph out. Since #99

//! cosmic-text type reaches the paint path.
//!
//! Three lifetimes meet here and are deliberately not the same:
//!
//! - **Shaped paragraphs** are CPU state of one painter, keyed by content and
//!   style. A repaint of unchanged text reuses them.
//! - **Glyph bitmaps** are CPU state too, keyed by face instance, size,
//!   subpixel bin and synthesis — never by color, opacity or transform.
//! - **Atlas placements** are device state, shared by every window on one
//!   device and reachable only through a generational handle, so eviction and
//!   compaction cannot be observed as the wrong glyph.
