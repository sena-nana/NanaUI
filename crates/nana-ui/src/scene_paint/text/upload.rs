//! Glyph atlas uploads: one region per newly placed or relocated glyph.
//!
//! Never the whole atlas. A frame that adds one glyph to a full page writes
//! that glyph's rectangle and nothing else, which is the difference between a
//! few hundred bytes and a megabyte of texture traffic per frame.
//!
//! In-flight safety is `wgpu::Queue::write_texture`'s: it copies the bytes
//! into queue-owned staging at call time and orders the transfer ahead of the
//! next submission, so nothing here can overwrite a region the GPU is still
//! reading. That is the reason this queue stages through the `Queue` rather
//! than keeping a hand-rolled ring — a ring would have to track fences that
//! the painter, which owns neither the submit nor the surface, cannot see.
