//! `nana_text::TextLayout` — into [`NanaGlyphRun`]s over a flat
//! [`PlacedGlyph`] arena, and every stage below this module only ever sees
//! that IR plus [`GlyphRasterKey`].
//!
//! The split that matters is which facts are in the raster key and which are
//! not. Text color, node opacity and the scene transform change where a glyph
//! lands and how it is tinted, never the bitmap, so they stay on the run and
//! out of the key — otherwise one label in two colors would rasterize twice.
