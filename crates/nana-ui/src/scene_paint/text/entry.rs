//! `TextGpuEntry`: one text node's glyphs, kept between frames.
//!
//! Everything above this module produces a paragraph's glyphs from scratch:
//! shape it, resolve every glyph, rasterize what is missing, place it in the
//! atlas. That work is proportional to the text on screen and it used to
//! happen on every frame that rebatched — which is every frame with any
//! animation in it, anywhere.
//!
//! An entry is the answer: the resolved instances of one node, held in a slab
//! and handed back whenever the facts they were derived from still hold.
//!
//! ```text
//! layout unchanged  ── the laid-out paragraph is the same one
//! colors unchanged  ── its rich spans still paint what they painted
//! phase unchanged   ── the bitmaps were rasterized for this sub-pixel offset
//! scale unchanged   ── they were placed at this device scale and raster step
//! fonts unchanged   ── the face set still issues these face ids
//! atlas unchanged   ── the rectangles are still these glyphs'
//! ```
//!
//! All but the last are compared in `prepare`; a mismatch rebuilds that one
//! entry and nothing else. The atlas is repaired rather than rebuilt: the
//! entry keeps one atlas handle per glyph, so a relocation only has to re-read
//! rectangles.
//!
//! What an entry deliberately does **not** hold is where its text sits, what
//! *solid* color it paints, how opaque it is or what transform it is under.
//! Those are the run and presentation rows of [`super::pipeline`], which is
//! why moving, fading or recoloring plain text never touches a single
//! instance. Rich spans are the exception, and the one they prove: a span
//! paints something the run row cannot say, so its bytes are baked into the
//! instances and `colors` is what notices when they change.

///   Space given back merges with the space beside it, so the holes growing

///   it and the instance from there — so two entries batch when their
///   *ranges* are adjacent, wherever their instances are. A range that had to
///   be placed elsewhere costs its command one more draw, and when enough of
