//! The standalone host's startup (Issue #225): the window, its device request
//! on a thread of its own and its splash first, then the program and the
//! handoff.
//!
//! The ordering rules live in [`StartupCoordinator`], kept off the window and
//! GPU calls so each of them can be tested on a machine with no display. The
//! host feeds it what happened — the program became ready, a takeover was
//! asked for or withdrawn, a frame was presented — and asks it two questions:
//! may the primary window present yet, and does this presented frame end the
//! splash. Frames that were skipped, retried or failed never reach it: the
//! host only reports a frame after its `present` succeeded.
//!
//! Everything that only matters until the handoff lives in [`ActiveStartup`]
//! and is dropped with it; afterwards the host keeps nothing but the record.
