//! Resolved per-window presentation.
//!
//! A window has exactly one [`ResolvedWindowPresentation`], and it is the only
//! authority for what that window presents:
//!
//! - `requested` is the business request. It decides what the host *asks* the
//!   platform and the surface for, and nothing else.
//! - `effective` is what the surface could actually negotiate. It decides the
//!   clear colour, what the program is told, and the native chrome.
//! - `chrome` is derived from `effective` when the presentation is resolved, so
//!   there is no later place that could re-derive it from the request and land
//!   on the other answer.
//!
//! The state this type exists to make unreachable is "the renderer thinks
//! `Solid`, the HWND still wears transparent chrome": a `Transparent` request
//! on a DX12 HWND surface negotiates `Opaque`, falls back to `Solid`, and the
//! window must lose the transparent frame policy in the same step.
//!
//! The presentation *target* is settled before the window is created, because
//! `WS_EX_NOREDIRECTIONBITMAP` is a creation-time ex-style bit nothing can set
//! durably afterwards. Everything below that says "before the window exists"
//! says it for this reason.
