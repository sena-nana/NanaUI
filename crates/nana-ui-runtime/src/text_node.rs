//! Retained text state per node, and the dirty graph that decides what a
//! mutation costs the text pipeline (Issue #95).
//!
//! A text node does not carry a single `dirty = true`. Every mutation that can
//! touch text names *what* changed as a [`TextDirty`] class, and
//! [`TextDirty::work`] is the one place that says which text work that class
//! implies:
//!
//! ```text
//! CONTENT / FONT / SHAPE_STYLE -> shape + layout + scene text geometry
//! CONSTRAINT                    -> layout + scene text geometry
//! EDIT_STATE                    -> editor overlay / caret
//! PAINT                         -> scene paint only
//! TRANSFORM / OPACITY           -> compositor only
//! ```
//!
//! [`TextNodeState::invalidate`] turns a class into revision bumps, and a
//! resolved node remembers the revisions it was resolved at
//! ([`TextStamp`]). Deciding that a node needs no text work is therefore a
//! comparison of a few integers — before its text is cloned, hashed or looked
//! up — and a paint or compositor class cannot reach a shaping or layout
//! revision because it does not bump one.
//!
//! Today the text passes consume the shape and layout half of the graph.
//! Scene extraction still re-extracts a render-dirty node whole, so the paint,
//! geometry, overlay and compositor work classes (and the `paint` / `edit`
//! revisions) are the contract a renderer drawing retained layouts (#97) and
//! the editable path (#96) key on, not yet a finer extraction.
