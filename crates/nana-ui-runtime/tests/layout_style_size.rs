//! The size that decides where theme intent gets resolved.
//!
//! `docs/theme.md` §1.5 resolves sizing intent when a node's style is
//! *written*, not when it is read, and resolves colour the other way round.
//! The only reason for the split is that a colour is 16 bytes and a
//! `LayoutStyle` is three orders of magnitude larger: putting the box on the
//! read path meant copying it per control per frame, which measured +196% on
//! a palette switch.
//!
//! So the rationale rests on a number. If `LayoutStyle` ever becomes small,
//! the split stops being justified and should be revisited rather than
//! inherited. This test is what makes that a decision instead of an accident.

/// Measured 4808 bytes on 2026-09-19. The bound is deliberately loose: the
/// exact figure moves with field layout and is not the point. "Too big to
/// copy on a hot path" is the point.
